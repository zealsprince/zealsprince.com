# Hey there! I'm Andrew! #

I've spent over a decade working as a software engineer and architect, and it's been one heck of a ride. From indie game development to co-founding a successful startup, I've had the chance to build some awesome things over the years!

Alongside my engineering and development work I also create digital and physical art ranging from album covers all the way to motion graphics, animations and visualizations. I've also dipped my feet into music production to round things off. After all, I'm known as the "Andrew of all trades" and try to live up to that title.
