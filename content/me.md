Creative Demon.

## Who this ? ##

zealsprince is my primary online handle. I use it for most of my online presence and is generally a more recognizable name than my real name. I also use it for my game development, digital art, animation, music and modding work.

Although there's clearly overlap between my professional and personal work, I try to keep them separate. Practicing good digital hygiene I suppose.

In general zealsprince is where I experiment more, try new things and manage more casual projects especially related to games and online community management.

## Game Development ##

My main interest in game development is in the indie scene. I love the creativity and freedom that comes with it as well as the community aspect and the vast creative spectrum of disciplines involved. I love to experiment with new ideas and concepts, and indie game development is the perfect place for that.

You'll see me join game jams from time to time but primarily these days I focus on modding of existing games. I find it a great way to learn and experiment with new ideas while also being able to share my work with others.

There's a good chance you'll recognize some of my mods especially for Lethal Company.

Professionally, I've worked with indie game developers at Mojang Studios (specifically the previous Oxeye Games developers), Klei Entertainment and more, having done testing and engaged in feedback cycles.

## Digital Art ##

In the past I've done most of my digital art as Catlinman, but I've since transitioned to using zealsprince for all my creative work. There's not nearly as much of that as there is for Catlinman right now, but I'm working on it (professional life and art can be tricky to balance!)

Most of my work you'll find is for myself, but I've also received commissions from music artists on labels such as Monstercat, NCS and more to create cover art as well as animated visuals and music videos. I'm always open to new commissions and projects, so feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together!
